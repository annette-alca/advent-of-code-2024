    "- `outputEachLine` also evaluates whether the expected resulting value is within this final array. If so, it returns the expected resulting value. If not, it returns 0.\n",

    "The <ins>Part 2</ins> approach is the same. The only difference is that the expanding numpy array contains more numbers (products, sums, and now the concatenated numer) as operators are taken from left to right. Function `threeVals` is used in place of twoVals in Part 1.\n",
