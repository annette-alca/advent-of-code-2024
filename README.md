These are Jupyter notebooks of my Python solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2024.

All solutions in this repo are complete, although some have more descriptions and docstrings than others. And I continue to work on these challenges to fill the gaps before day25. 

My solutions use a mix of matrices, arrays, recursive functions, numpy operations, and classes. They're a fun way to practice both coding and creative problem-solving.
